**Change 1**

The `extends` feature described in `Language 1` still applies.


**Change 2**

Each file should start with a `<profile> <min-version>;` declaration.
- the `core` profile compiles on all platforms.
- the `browser` profile compiles on browsers, with additional access to browser built-ins.
- the `native` profile compiles on native platforms, with additional access to OS-level built-ins.

After the profile string, a profile version can be specified.
Thus, evolving profiles can be used to gate features,
and native and browser profiles can consume other core profile modules 
(though not the other way around).

**Example 1**

```
CORE_PROFILE 0.0.0;

mod share {
    Msg = enum {
        Startup {client_id Int32, lobby_id Int32}
    };
};
```

**Example 2**

```
BROWSER_PROFILE 0.0.0;

import share from "./share.pd";

mod client {
    main = anonymous_fn (inout document Document) -> Void {};
};
```

**Example 3**

```
NATIVE_PROFILE 0.0.0;

import share from "./share.pd";

mod server {
    main = anonymous_fn () Int32 (0);
};
```
