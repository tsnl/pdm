Compilation is composed of multiple **tasks.**
Each task is a granular file transformation or set of transformations for the compiler to perform.
Tasks are specified in **index files**, and can be executed using the `pdm` command (c.f. `npx`).

When the user runs
```shell
pdm build-server
```
the following steps occur (assuming the task is executed successfully):

1.  the compiler finds a `pd-tasks.json` file in the working directory.
2.  the compiler looks up a task named `build-server` in the tasks file.
3.  the compiler begins executing the `build-server` task.

Depending on the type of task, the compiler may need to take additional steps.

`BUILD_NATIVE_EXECUTABLE_FILE` and `BUILD_BROWSER_WASM_FILE` require...
- (lazily) loading any new source code required
- checking the entry point source is of the correct profile
- checking the entry point module has the right interface

`EXTERN_MODULE_IN_C`
- since it's a part of 'index' and not 'tasks', means promoting other language's code to first-class.
