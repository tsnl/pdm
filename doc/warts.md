# Warts

- List syntax is in limbo.
  - template instantiation is much more frequent than creating a list or slice
  - variadic functions using templates (like C++, Scala List(...)) can address this gap.
- Unions removed for now, can be figured out later. Symbols may suffice?
- Explicit return statements are optional.
