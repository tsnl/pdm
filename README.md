# The PDM Programming Language SDK

This branch contains an old C version of the compiler.

It compiles a slightly different language than the release version into LLVM, and was a great learning experience.

**TODO:** Cleanup, separate the C code, revert to older commits where it builds (currently mixed with new C++ version)
