Rather than try to maintain perfect documentation and wind up in the dark,
I will instead rely on this informal `news` directory to jot down ideas as
they crop up.
At a later date, all `news` can be trawled for the latest versions of 
specification.

Right now, I am working on different projects, since working on the compiler
for too long results in features being added that are of no practical benefit.

I am already learning a lot on this journey.
